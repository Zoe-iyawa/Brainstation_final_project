# Bank Churn Rate Analysis

This project aims to analyze the churn rate of bank customers to uncover patterns and insights related to customer attrition.
By using data cleaning in Excel, SQL for data querying, and Tableau for visualization, the project provides a clear, data-driven view of factors associated with customer churn.

## Key Components:
1) Data Cleaning (Excel): Prepared and structured raw data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting for consistency.
2) Data Analysis (SQL): Queried the dataset to explore key customer metrics, segment customer demographics, and identify trends related to churn.
3) Data Visualization (Tableau): Created interactive dashboards to visualize customer churn patterns, allowing for easy exploration of factors such as customer tenure, account activity, and demographics.
